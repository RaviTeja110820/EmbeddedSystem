# **EmbeddedSystem**


## **Introduction**

### **Embedded System**

* It is  a combination of <ins> Both Hardware and Software with some mechanical parts </ins> to perform a <ins>specific task </ins> is called Embedded System.
* mobile is not is embedded system, it is a General purpose machine.
* Example: Printer, Induction Stove , Washing Machine

### **Classification of Embedded System**

1. Realtime Embedded System 
    * System which completes the TASK within Specific Time
      * Hard real time -- Nuclear Reactor
      * soft real time -- Game Controller
2. Network Embedded System 
    * Communicate with other Embedded Systems through ethernet or local area network or some other devices like routers.
3. Mobile Embedded System 
    * which act as a standalone
    * example : pacemakers (which has to operated by battery for a long time)
